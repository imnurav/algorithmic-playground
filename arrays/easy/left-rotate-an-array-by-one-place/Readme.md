# Left Rotate an array by one place

Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the left by one.

Note: There is no need to return anything, just modify the given array.

Examples:
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 1]

Explanation:

# Left Rotate an array by one place

Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the left by one.

Note: There is no need to return anything, just modify the given array.

Examples:
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 1]

Explanation:

Initially, nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Rotating once to left -> nums = [2, 3, 4, 5, 1]

Input: nums = [-1, 0, 3, 6]

Output: [0, 3, 6, -1]

Explanation:

Initially, nums = [-1, 0, 3, 6]

Rotating once to left -> nums = [0, 3, 6, -1]

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 105
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
